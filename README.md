# Machine Learning with Python Course

This repository contains my completed work for the "Machine Learning with Python" course taught by Frederick Nwanganga. This course provides an introduction to machine learning and step-by-step guidance on how to get started with machine learning using Python.

## Course Overview

The course covers the following topics:

- What it means for machines to learn and the different ways they learn.
- How to collect, understand, and prepare data for machine learning.
- Guided examples of how to accomplish each step using Python.
- Building, evaluating, and interpreting the results of a machine learning model in Python.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data`: contains the datasets used in the course.
- `notebooks`: contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the course.
- `README.md`: this file.


## Course Completion

By completing this course, I have gained an understanding of the basics of machine learning and how to apply it using Python. Specifically, I have learned:

- What machine learning is and how it works.
- The different types of machine learning algorithms and when to use them.
- How to prepare data for machine learning using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy.
- How to build, evaluate, and interpret the results of a machine learning model using Python libraries such as scikit-learn and matplotlib.

I am confident that the skills I have acquired in this course will be useful for future projects involving machine learning and Python.
